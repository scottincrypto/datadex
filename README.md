Datadex is a platform where people collaborate on Open Data using modern and open source tools and frameworks.

### üí° Principles

- **Open**: Play well with the ecosystem. Use open standards and share data in open formats.
- **Modular**: Each component can be replaced, extended, or removed. Works well in many environments (your laptop, in a cluster, or from the browser), and with multiple tools (thanks to the Arrow ecosystem).
- **Permissionless**. Don't ask, fork it and improve the models, add a new source or update any script.
- **Data as Code**. Declarative stateless transformations tracked in `git`. Version your data as code! Publish and share your reusable models for others to build on top.
- **Modern**: Supports types, tests, materialized views, and more.

Datadex isn't a new tool, it is an opinionated bridge between existing ones.

### üöÄ What can you do with Datadex?

- Model [existing datasets using `dbt` and `SQL` like you would do in your company](dbt/models/climate/sources.yml). You can use and abuse any of the other awesome `dbt` features like `tests` and `docs` ([automatically generated and published on GitHub Pages](https://davidgasquez.github.io/datadex/docs)).
- Explore your data with Rill or Jupyter Notebooks. [Share your findings with others](https://davidgasquez.github.io/datadex/notebooks/2023-05-06-quarto.html) by publishing your notebooks online as beautiful static websites (thanks to Quarto).
- Add new sources via Dagster, dbt Python models, or dbt Plugins. Bring data locally and work with it!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

The fastest way to start using Datadex is via [VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Once inside the develpment environment, you'll only need to run `make deps`.

PS: The development environment can also run in your browser thanks to GitHub Codespaces!

## üéØ Motivation

This small project was created after [thinking how an Open Data Protocol could look like](https://publish.obsidian.md/davidgasquez/Open+Data)!

## üëè Acknowledgements

- This proof of concept was created thanks to open source projects like [DuckDB](https://www.duckdb.org/) and [dbt](https://getdbt.com).
- Datadex name was inspired by [Juan Benet awesome `data` projects](https://juan.benet.ai/blog/2014-03-11-discussion-scienceexchange/).
