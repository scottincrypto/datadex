    "text": "Reports are a great way to share your work with others. Thanks to Quarto and Datadex, you can create beautiful reports with a few lines of code and share them with the world. Let‚Äôs go through a few interesting things we can do.\nStarting with the most basic thing, we can display Pandas DataFrames as tables.\n\n\nCode\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\ntable = [\n    [\"Sun\", 696000, 1989100000],\n    [\"Earth\", 6371, 5973.6],\n    [\"Moon\", 1737, 73.5],\n    [\"Mars\", 3390, 641.85],\n]\nMarkdown(tabulate(table, headers=[\"Planet\", \"R (km)\", \"mass (x 10^29 kg)\"]))\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Planets\n\n\nPlanet\nR (km)\nmass (x 10^29 kg)\n\n\n\n\nSun\n696000\n1.9891e+09\n\n\nEarth\n6371\n5973.6\n\n\nMoon\n1737\n73.5\n\n\nMars\n3390\n641.85\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, plotting arbitrary data is easy.\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.plot([1, 23, 2, 4])\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([8, 65, 23, 90])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Second\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Charts\n\n\n\nWe can improve the graphs making them dynamic!\n\n\nCode\nimport altair as alt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nalt.themes.enable(\"vox\")\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\nsource = pd.DataFrame(\n    np.cumsum(np.random.randn(100, 3), 0).round(2),\n    columns=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n    index=pd.RangeIndex(100, name=\"x\"),\n)\nsource = source.reset_index().melt(\"x\", var_name=\"category\", value_name=\"y\")\n\n# Create a selection that chooses the nearest point & selects based on x-value\nnearest = alt.selection_point(nearest=True, on=\"mouseover\", fields=[\"x\"], empty=False)\n\n# The basic line\nline = (\n    alt.Chart(source)\n    .mark_line(interpolate=\"basis\")\n    .encode(x=\"x:Q\", y=\"y:Q\", color=\"category:N\")\n)\n\n# Transparent selectors across the chart.
